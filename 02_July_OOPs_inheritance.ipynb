    "\n",
    "Ans. Inheritance in object-oriented programming is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviour of anohter existing class. The new class is called \"Derived Class\" or \"Child Class\" while the existing class is called \"Parent class\" or \"base class\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. Single Inheritance is a form of inheritance where a class inherits only single parent class. It is very simple form of inheritance hence also called Simple Inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance is form inheritance where a class inherits more than one parent class. It inherits the properties of all the Parent Classes and has an access to their objects. It more complicated and difficult to maintain then single inheritance."

    "Ans. 'protected' access modifier can be accessable the method or dtat member of the calss from within or outisde the package but only through Inheritance. They have more accessability than 'private' and 'public' modifiers. Public modifiers are accessable to anywhere whereas 'private' modifiers are acccessable in the class they are declared."
